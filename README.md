# This is the development branch for Version 2 do not use in production

## New Features in v2:

- Added text hosting (like pastebin)
- Added URL shortening
- Added WebP to images (and conversion from jpg,png to webp)
- Massive code rework. Actually we designed it from the ground up to be more modular and easier to debug
